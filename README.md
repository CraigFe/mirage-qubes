mirage-qubes
============

Implementations of various Qubes protocols:

- `Qubes.RExec`: provide services to other VMs
- `Qubes.GUI`: just enough of the GUI protocol so that Qubes accepts the AppVM
- `Qubes.DB`: read and write the VM's QubesDB database

See [qubes-mirage-skeleton][] for an example using this library.
